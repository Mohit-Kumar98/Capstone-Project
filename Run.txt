How to Use the Code:

	1.	Install Required Libraries:

pip install openai PyPDF2 spacy sentence-transformers faiss-cpu python-docx


	2.	Download spaCy Model:

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


	3.	Set Your OpenAI API Key:
	•	Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key in the code.
	4.	Run the Script:
	•	Save the code in a file, for example financial_report_summarizer.py.
	•	Execute the script with Python, providing the path to the PDF and the desired output path for the summary:

python financial_report_summarizer.py


	5.	Customize the Extractors:
	•	Modify the extract_business_overview, extract_business_segment_overview, and extract_geographical_breakdown functions to better match your specific data extraction needs and patterns.

This script will process the financial report PDF, extract relevant sections, generate embeddings, retrieve relevant text chunks, and then summarize the text using OpenAI’s GPT model, finally saving the summaries into a Word document.
